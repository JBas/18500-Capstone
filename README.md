# 18500_Capstone
This repo contains the src code and documentation for 18500 Capstone Team E1!

For our Capstone  project, we decided to create a 3D Printer Error Detection System.
We decided that this would be a suitable project for the semester, given that it
encompasses multiple different ECE areas (Software / Signals / Hardware),
and could prove useful as current 3D printing companies are starting to look at this technology as well.
